      <h1>Dark Souls III wiki</h1>
      <p>Made by LHRM</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's yet another Dark Souls wiki, have a look around, most shit don't work yet tho... <br />
        The goal of this site is to give me more experience with coding and building sites. <br />With every try and itteration my intent is to make my code more dynamic and up to date with industry standards. <br />
        In hopes that I can show off this site to a potential employer in the future, and that it will give off a good impression of my skills.
